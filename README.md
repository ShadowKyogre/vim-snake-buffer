Vim Snake Buffer
================

This is a simple plugin that allows you to quickly create additional windows
that are scrollbound to the originating window that spawned them.

It defines two commands:

* **SnakeBuffer {n}** - Generate n additional windows for the buffer. Add a 
  bang modifier force relayout the snaked buffer.
* **SnakeClose** - Close the windows that were generated by SnakeBuffer for
  the specific window. You can also close the originating window by adding
  a bang to the command.
