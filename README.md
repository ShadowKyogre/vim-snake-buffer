Vim Snake Buffer
================

This is a simple plugin that allows you to quickly create additional windows
that are scrollbound to the originating window that spawned them.

It defines four commands:

* **SnakeBuffer {n}** - Generate n additional windows for the buffer. Add a
  bang modifier force relayout the snaked buffer.
* **SnakeToggle [{n}]** - Generate n additional windows for the buffer. If no
  argument is supplied, SnakeToggle will attempt to calculate the maximum 
  number of columns that can be used to display your buffer. Adding a
  bang forces SnakeToggle to use your configured textwidth for the buffer 
  instead of the longest line length.
* **SnakeAdjust** - Adjust the layout of the currently snaked set of windows.
  This is useful if you wind up resizing your window a lot.
* **SnakeClose** - Close the windows that were generated by SnakeBuffer for
  the specific window. You can also close the originating window by adding
  a bang to the command.
